# Object Oriented OpenGL

Here I'll be taking what I learn in the sandbox and making it more object oriented. This still won't be the nicest code you've ever seen but I'll be cementing what I learned about OpenGL in the sandbox and trying to make some decent c++ code out of it (learning c++ as I go).
